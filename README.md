Car Site contents

Using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, javascript, and jQuery I've created a responsive
web page for a fictional car buying expert. The content from an advertising perspective
is not very clear, but my focus was to make sure the web page was responsive.

It is optimized for Chrome, but works in Firefox and Safari as well.
